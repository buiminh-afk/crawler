By adopting A2A, TMA enables its AI agents to operate independently while seamlessly exchanging information, coordinating tasks, and working together across different departments. This multi-agent approach allows T-VA to handle complex workflows such as synchronizing data, supporting multi-channel customer interactions, and generating consolidated reports from multiple sources‚Äîall triggered by a single input request. The application of the A2A protocol significantly expands the capabilities of individual agents, improving operational efficiency and accuracy in real-world business processes. As A2A continues to evolve toward a stable standard expected by late 2025, TMA‚Äôs early adoption positions it at the forefront of leveraging next-generation AI interoperability for advanced automation solutions. üí´ Explore more: , , ,",

These agents are goal-oriented, adaptive, and capable of perceiving data, reasoning through it, acting on decisions, and learning from feedback to improve over time. They can be organized in architectures such as multi-agent networks or hierarchical structures and collaborate via interaction paradigms like parallel, sequential, loop, or router models. Despite their transformative potential across industries, autonomous AI raises ethical, security, and regulatory challenges. TMA Solutions develops advanced autonomous AI agents that enhance healthcare and business processes, such as telehealth chatbots offering real-time medical recommendations, onboarding assistants, self-diagnosis tools, and chatbot performance evaluators.

TMA and ADLINK have partnered to create our cutting-edge Edge AI Surveillance solution, ready to redefine security and efficiency in smart buildings. T-Cam is a device that combines the capabilities of an ordinary digital camera with the processing power of AI-powered computers. \"Edge\" means that these devices can process and analyze data at their local location, or at the network's edge, rather than being sent to a central server or cloud for processing. These cameras can make instant decisions on the factory floor through real-time image processing and data analysis, making it possible to improve efficiency and reduce interruptions. T-Cam Development: 1. Flexible Deployment:¬†The T-Cam system is adaptable to be used in a variety of surveillance structures. It is also capable of upgrading existing surveillance systems without needing to build new infrastructure. 2. Low Latency:¬†The Edge AI cameras process data on-device, lowering latency through the use of surveillance video streams that are analyzed by EOS-JNX at the edge and eliminating video transmission to the AI inferencing server in a cloud, as well as decreasing network load. 3. Personnel Private:¬†T-Cam systems can be set up to handle data locally and minimize the risk of data breaches or unwanted data access. This ensures video events and personal information are kept private.",

It‚Äôs about raising the right capital. I believe it‚Äôs critical to form partnerships with those who understand the industry. People who‚Äôve been on the ground, who get the challenges, and who want to be part of a solution not just a return. Too often, traditional venture capital is focused on one thing: profit. And while sustainability and growth are essential, they shouldn‚Äôt come at the cost of cutting corners or ignoring the deeper issues we‚Äôre trying to fix. An industry investor brings more than money they bring experience, insight, credibility, and alignment with the mission. They‚Äôre not just backing a company; they‚Äôre backing the future of the industry they care about. So, if you‚Äôve received an invitation to join something that could truly reshape the way we work, this is your chance to be part of a solution that puts improvement before profit, and purpose before valuation. Let‚Äôs build something that makes a difference together.",

While that industry has witnessed some spectacular rises and falls, the use of GPUs for other technological advances has been growing steadily on a much more stable track. The use of GPUs for complex and computationally expensive ML (Machine Learning) and AI (Artificial Intelligence) workflows offers incredible benefits in terms of performance. However, due to the starkly different approach for processing tasks, building and utilizing models using GPU-driven infrastructure can be quite challenging. NVIDIA RAPIDS aims to provide a GPU-compatible suite of ML tools, that can be utilized to create ML and AI workflows that are similar to those that are created with typical and widely used ML toolsets, such as Pandas and Scikit-Learn. TMA Solutions‚Äô Data Science Centre recently set about investigating this suite of tools and assessing their usability and performance. Read more at:",

    "caption": "Benchmarking Performance Improvements when Utilising GPU for Machine Learning with NVIDIA RAPIDS (Part 2) When discussing GPU-accelerated computing, one of the most commonly mentioned points is the potential performance benefits that it can offer. NVIDIA state that when analysing datasets in the range of 10TB, RAPIDS can perform up to 20 times faster on GPUs than the top CPU baseline. Our team was curious to see whether RAPIDS could provide similar performance benefits on datasets of a somewhat smaller scale. The team set out to investigate the performance benefits of RAPIDS on GPUs, by carrying out a number of experiments, assessing the time taken to build and test three different models. For these experiments we chose to first build a K-means clustering model, followed by a random forest classifier, and then used VLAD encoding with the K-means algorithm for image clustering. Our first two experiments used randomly generated data, while the third used a dataset of images of famous international tourist sites. We carried out our initial experiments with different dataset sizes, ranging from just 100 rows and 5,000 data points to 10 million rows and 500 million data points. For our third experiment, we used an image dataset which contained approximately 2GB of images. As we use a range of dataset sizes for our first two experiments, showing a significant performance increase here would highlight that RAPIDS can offer performance benefits across a broad spectrum of datasets and use cases. In this blog post we will also mention the lower limits of these performance benefits and discuss where GPUs fail to produce better results. Read more: 1. TMA AU: 2. TMA EU:",
